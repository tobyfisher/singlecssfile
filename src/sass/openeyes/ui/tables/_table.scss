// The most common use of <table> is in SEM Elements
// Therefore, the starting point for styling is with
// tables as used in SEM Elements (default DOM)

table {
	// all tables must fill there container
	// width control is via a <div> wrapper
	width: 100%;

	// Although using 'table-layout:fixed' optimises the speed
	// at which the browser can layout tabular data it messes up the current
	// approach to layouts which makes use of the flexibility of not specifying some columns
	// table-layout: fixed; -- if using all <colgroup> approaches will need reviewing!! (prob. need 24 column grid!)

	// provide vertical spacing around table by default
	// unless 'no-pad' is requested
	&.standard:not(.no-pad) {
		margin:20px 0 10px 0;
	}
