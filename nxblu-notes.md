# "newblue" to "nxblu"
### (5.x.x to 6.0.0)

## Change over notes

During the change over to nxblu, it is recommend that you keep a way within OE to switch between "newblue" and "nxblu" if there any issues with the new CSS. **nxblu** is tracking the latest release of newblue at all times during the change over to allow easy roll-back/forward.
